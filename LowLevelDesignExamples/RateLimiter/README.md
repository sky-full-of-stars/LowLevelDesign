#Rate Limiter

###A rate limiter is used to restrict the rate at which a resource is accessed.


###The requirement is to implement a Rate Limiter that can wrap any function call and prevent calls in excess of the specified limit.



First a rate limiter is configured with the allowed rate limit as shown:
RateLimiter limiter = new RateLimiter(allowedRate, window)
For example:
new RateLimiter(10, 10Sec) - Allow 10 calls within a 10 sec window
new RateLimiter(50, 1Min) - Allow 50 calls within a 1 min window


Once configured it can be used to wrap any Function F<Input, Output> to apply a rate limit.
Example:
Function<I,O> rateLimitedFunc = rateLimiter.wrap(Function<I,O> func);
For example, say we have a function
Function<Integer, Integer> square = (x)->x*x;
We can construct a ratelimited version of this via
Function<Integer,Integer> rateLimitedSquare = rateLimiter.wrap(square);


The wrap method takes a Function and returns a Function with same signature.
The clients can then call the wrapped function in the same way as the original function.
Example: f.apply(4)
When this wrapped function receives more calls than allowed it should fail the excess requests.


After implementing the function write test cases to verify the functionality of RateLimiter.
